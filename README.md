Once you read the instructions, click on the view button on the bottom right.

Once you're in the new page, enter your name and choose the difficulty level. This is so that we can keep score. Please note that that newly added data will not be persisted on 
refreshes because there is not database connected.

Once you click start/submit. A timer will begin. On the left of the cells in the grid you can drag and drop the items in the grid to arrange them in ascending order.

Once you are happy with your order, submit your order by clicking the button on the top left of the grid.

A process will then be checked if your sorting is correct and you will be given a message depending on your result. If you do not order
them properly, your items will still remain in the same position and you can make changes accordingly.
